This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  After selecting a file, the promise sometimes unexpectedly rejects with an error message that doesn't provide a clear indication of the cause. The error might be a generic network error, or it might suggest a problem related to permissions, even when necessary permissions are already granted.  The issue is inconsistent; it doesn't happen every time, making debugging challenging.  Debugging is hampered by the lack of specific error details.
